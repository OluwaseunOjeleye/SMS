# SMS Movie Suggester Web App

##Problem Statement
Selecting the right and perfect movie to watch based on a mixture of genre and plot movie
watchers have in mind is not easy and this process takes a lot of time. A movie recommendation
web-based application that recommends movies (using movies features and some algorithms)
to a user without requiring users details can be developed to give users a better experience
whenever they want to watch a movie.
